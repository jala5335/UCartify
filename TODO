(Please do below on another branch so it doesn't break as the only function we currently have 
working is the sign up/login and population of account info)

- remove the first name, last name etc from account info since its not collected in the sign up page

- replicate the process of adding users to the database and retrieving it for products

- display said products on account info page, similar to account details

- fix images not displaying

- check login credentials being in the database

- make sure style/css errors are fixed

- fix non-unique ids

- remove login from accountinfo page/replace with logout (just redirect to the main screen)

- remove settings page
