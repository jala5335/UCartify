# UCartify

UCartify is a website that was created with the intent of helping customers have a convenient location to store products from 
around the internet. Through the use of MySQL, Node.js, javascript, css, and html we have been able to put together the one 
stop shop for users who may be a bit indecisive or would like to save up more money before they purchase something. Bookmarks 
and a countless number of open tabs can be both annoying and a lot for your computer to handle, but with UCartify you can 
close all your tabs and delete those bookmarks. With one website that can conveniently store the information and links to 
products you want to remember, online shopping has just become a whole lot easier. With well designed pages that are easy to 
navigate, we aspired to have a website that is easy on the eyes and well conceived. Mixing space and CU colors, 
U(niversal)Cartify keeps a theme as well as it keeps track of your shopping list. Whether someone is trying to keep track of 
birthday lists, wedding gifts, Christmas wishes, their own personal cart, or more, UCartify will always be there to keep track 
of your shopping needs. With pages dedicated solely to: a cart, personal information, registration, signing up, and an 
unregistered view, the team has tried to keep it simple and efficient. 

-To test code: start up a node server using "node.js", or simply directly access Ucartify.html or any of the other html pages. For the most part code is organized loosely by HTML file with corresponding JS/CSS files with "Node.js" being the overarching server file.
